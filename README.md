# What's this?
Just some ugly .NET standard code for parsing Hacker News HTML.

Yeah, please use the [official API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) where possible. 
Problem is that it's basically a dump of their in-memory data structures, so it's not always an ideal interface and of course with archived HTML pages, something like this is needed.
